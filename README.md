# Polite Python Webscraper

Collection of Python related code to build a web scraper for Andrew. Using this repo as a learning excercise for GitHub actions as well. We will use Python, beautifulsoup4, requests and selenium with Chrome driver to politely scrape websites.

## Create conda env

```conda env create -f conda_env.yml```

```conda activate polite_python_webscraper```

NB: The latest stable version of chromedriver_linux64.zip was in the system PATH @ /usr/local/bin prior to selenium install.
